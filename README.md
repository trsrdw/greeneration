### Waste Data

Waste Data is using random data from mockAPI so it can run in build mode. If running in localhost, you can choose whether to set Waste Data from me using waste.json file or keep using the mockAPI. If you want to use my data json, here are the steps you can follow:

1. Open terminal then go to this folder directory.
2. Run "npm install json-server".
3. Run "json-server --watch waste.json --port 5000".
4. Edit every fetch API function url to "http://localhost:5000/wastelist".
5. Done.
